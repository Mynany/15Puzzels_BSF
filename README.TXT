Example Program(R) Version 1.0 9/27/2018

FUNCTIONALITY
————————
- This project is to achieve a breadth first search algorithm for 15 puzzle game.
- FifteenPuzzel.java contains the BST search function
- State.java is the State class, including matrix, moves, and nodes for each state.
- Puzzle.java is the main function.

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
—————————————
To run this program, you only need to run Puzzle.java. You can change the input by changing the int array matrix in Puzzle.java.

ATTACHMENT
——————————
The reason that the Number of Nodes expanded is different from the instruction is probably because that the search order is different. Thus the point finding goal is different.
